;;  Hatch Pattern Definition related to ISO/DIS 12011 line types
;;
;;  (Width * 5 = Distance between lines)
;;
;;  The size of the line segments related to the ISO/DIS 12011 linetypes
;;  define the following hatch pattern. 
;;  The pen width of 1 mm is the base of the definition. To use them with
;;  the other ISO/DIS 12011 predefined pen widths, the line has to be scaled
;;  with the appropriate value (e.g. pen width 0,5 mm -> ltscale 0.5).

;;  Hatch Pattern Definition related to ISO/DIS 12011 line types
;;
;;  (Width * 5 = Distance between lines)
;;
;;  The size of the line segments related to the ISO/DIS 12011 linetypes
;;  define the following hatch pattern. 
;;  The pen width of 1 mm is the base of the definition. To use them with
;;  the other ISO/DIS 12011 predefined pen widths, the line has to be scaled
;;  with the appropriate value (e.g. pen width 0,5 mm -> ltscale 0.5).
